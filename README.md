# MathCam

Project created by **Bleotu Alexandru**, **Tisca Catalin** and **Florea Adela**.


The MathCam web app is designed to leverage your device's camera to recognize and solve mathematical equations in real-time. This open-source project aims to simplify the process of solving math problems, providing a convenient tool for users. The application employs computer vision techniques to accurately identify equations across various mathematical domains, including algebra, calculus, and geometry.

### Key Features:

-   Camera-based equation recognition
-   Real-time solutions for a diverse range of mathematical problems
-   Modular and extensible codebase for customization
